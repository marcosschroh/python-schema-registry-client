# Client

The `Schema Registry Client` consumes the API exposed by the `schema-registry` to operate resources that are `avro` schemas.

You probably won't use this but is good to know that exists. The `MessageSerialzer` is whom interact with the `SchemaRegistryClient`

## SchemaRegistryClient

```python
SchemaRegistryClient
    A client that talks to a Schema Registry over HTTP

    def __init__(
        self, url, ca_location=None, cert_location=None, key_location=None, key_password=None, extra_headers=None,
        timeout=httpx._config.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_CONFIG, pool_limits=httpx._config.DEFAULT_POOL_LIMITS

    Args:
        url (str|dict) url: Url to schema registry or dictionary containing client configuration.
        ca_location (str): File or directory path to CA certificate(s) for verifying the Schema Registry key.
        cert_location (str): Path to public key used for authentication.
        key_location (str): Path to private key used for authentication.
        key_password (str): Key password
        extra_headers (dict): Extra headers to add on every requests.
        timeout (httpx._client.TimeoutTypes): The timeout configuration to use when sending requests.
        pool_limits (httpx.Limits): The connection pool configuration to use when
            determining the maximum number of concurrently open HTTP connections.
```

## Methods

### Get Schema

Get Schema for a given version. If version is `None`, try to resolve the latest schema

```python
def get_schema(subject: str, version="latest", headers: dict = None, timeout: typing.Union[TimeoutTypes, UnsetType] = UNSET) -> utils.SchemaVersion:
    """

        timeout (httpx._client.TimeoutTypes): The timeout configuration to use when sending requests. Default UNSET

    Returns:
        utils.SchemaVersion (nametupled): (subject, schema_id, schema, version)

        None: If server returns a not success response:

### Delete Schema

        timeout (httpx._client.TimeoutTypes): The timeout configuration to use when sending requests. Default UNSET

    Returns:
        list (int): versions of the schema deleted under this subject
    """
```

### Check if a schema has already been registered under the specified subject

```python
def check_version(subject: str, avro_schema: client.schema.AvroSchema, headers: dict = None, timeout: typing.Union[TimeoutTypes, UnsetType] = UNSET) -> dict:

            id (int) -- Globally unique identifier of the schema
            version (int) -- Version of the returned schema
            schema (dict) -- The Avro schema

        None: If schema not found.

    """
    DELETE /subjects/(string: subject)/versions/(versionId: version)

    Deletes a specific version of the schema registered under this subject.
    This only deletes the version and the schema ID remains intact making
    it still possible to decode data using the schema ID.
    This API is recommended to be used only in development environments or
    under extreme circumstances where-in, its required to delete a previously
    registered schema for compatibility purposes or re-register previously registered schema.

    Args:
        subject (str): subject name
        version (str): Version of the schema to be deleted.
            Valid values for versionId are between [1,2^31-1] or the string "latest".

### Test Compatibility
